# Time Series Analysis With Deep Learning Techniques and Beyond

## Study Background
Time series analysis has wide applications in many fields such as economics, finance, computer sciences, engineering, and earth sciences, where understanding patterns and trends is important to decision making and predicting future behaviours. For example, the ground motion caused by an earthquake is recorded as a course of time. Time-series data are always noisy and high-dimensional. There features increase the difficulty of deep and precise analysis. Recent development in deep learning provides some new techniques for efficient time-series analysis. In this project, we aim to create new models of unsupervised learning of features for time series analysis and prediction. Applications into seismic data for earthquake identification & prediction and for petroleum exploration will be explored.
